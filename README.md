## What is it?
This is a simple windows app to show a message flashing red and white in fullscreen mode.

## For what?
I use it during commissioning of machines. In case long time endurance tests are running, this acts as bulletin board/warning sign on the machine's display panel.

## Why?
Spontaneous Sunday evening coding desire :)

## What is it written in?
This was written in C# with .net 4 and WPF.
